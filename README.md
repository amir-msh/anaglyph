## What is anaglyph?

> Anaglyph 3D is the stereoscopic 3D effect achieved by means of encoding each eye's image using filters of different (usually chromatically opposite) colors, typically red and cyan. Anaglyph 3D images contain two differently filtered colored images, one for each eye. When viewed through the "color-coded" "anaglyph glasses", each of the two images reaches the eye it's intended for, revealing an integrated stereoscopic image. The visual cortex of the brain fuses this into the perception of a three-dimensional scene or composition.

In other words, the anaglyph method is an easy and inexpensive way to create a 3D experience. This is a perfect option for those looking for an easy and inexpensive way to create 3D images.


## Features

- Turn almost any widget into a stunning 3D anaglyph version easily.   

- Adjust the 3D depth to customize the visual experience.

- Smoothly apply changes with built-in animations.

## Quick Start Guide

- Use `AnaglyphView` to create a 3D appearance.  

- Use `AnaglyphStyle` to set a default anaglyph style for subtrees.  

- Use `AnimatedAnaglyphStyle` to apply anaglyph style changes with a custom animation.  

## Basic Usage

```dart
AnaglyphView(
    depth: -7,
    child: Image.network(
        'https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/thumbnails/image/pillars_of_creation.jpg',
    ),
),
```

### Special Scenarios

#### Transparent Background

If you want to wrap the widgets that have a transparent background (e.g. Text, Icon, FlutterLogo) in `AnaglyphView`, make sure that `clipOuters` is false:

```dart
AnaglyphView(
    depth: -4,
    clipOuters: false,
    child: FlutterLogo(size: 250),
),
```
